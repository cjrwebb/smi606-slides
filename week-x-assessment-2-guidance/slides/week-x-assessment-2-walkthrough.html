**Code**

It does not matter if your code is messy, inefficient, hard to read, poorly commented/not commented at all, uses functions or packages outside of what I have taught you, etc. **as long as it works and you interpret the output correctly**.

It is good to have clear, efficient, easy to read, well-explained code but this is **not** a learning outcome for the module.

### Introduction, rationale, research question

.pull-left[

**Precursor: Find a dataset where you can answer a question you're interested in and identify the kind of method you'll need to use to answer it**

Picking a dataset

* Look in the [description of datasets file](https://vle.shef.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/xid-43961409_1) found on the assessments page *or* find some data you are interested in. There are many to choose from this time around, and you can also pick your own from places like the [UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/), the [TidyTuesday archive](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), the [DataIsPlural archive](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/), or others. Link to description of datasets. **Give yourself plenty of time to find some data and a question you're interested in**

* Try and pick something you are interested in (the assessment will be less painful that way)

]


--

.pull-right[

Coming up with a research question...

* Are you interested in whether some variables are able to predict a certain outcome, or inequalities in a certain outcome (e.g. what might contribute to some people go to university or not; whether there is unequal access to good-quality housing; whether people with caring responsibilities are more likely to have more prosocial tendencies at Age 17)?

* Are you interested in whether there is evidence of stratification of people into distinctive groups and are there any external predictors of these groups (e.g. do people have specific tastes in humour that can be grouped and are younger people less likely to appreciate humour at the expense of others? Are there archetypes of stereotypical gender expression and are younger people more likely to be assigned to groups with more mixed masculine and feminine gender expression stereotypes)?

Coming up with a research question...

* Are you interested in how something might be geographically unequal across space (e.g. does deprivation compound across geography, in other words, are people at greater risk of multiple forms of deprivation depending on where they live? Is employment deprivation more spatially concentrated in Northern cities than in Southern cities? Are the effects of climate change more likely to be concentrated in the Global South? How does social identity shape segregation between neighbourhoods, and does contemporary segregation reflect historic structural segregation?)? 


**Each of these kinds of questions implies different methods (from weeks 8-11), or combinations of methods, to answer.**

### Introduction, rationale, research question

.pull-left[

**Rationale**

*Identifying the novelty of your research question.* 

* **What are you doing that hasn't been done before?**
  * Good reasons: "new" data, more "up-to-date" research, "lack of research on this topic", "not researched in England before". Sometimes legitimate but not very compelling.
  * Better reasons: novel application of a method or novel inclusion of a variable (have previous studies only used bivariate regression not multiple? Have previous studies not included some other predictors that might confound results? Have previous studies lacked a spatial dimension? Have attempts at cluster analysis not been done before?); novel unit of analysis (have other studies only considered neighbourhoods, not individuals, or vice versa?); pressing contemporary policy matter, or matter of social importance (inequality, justice, climate crisis, innovation, inclusion of marginalised group)

Research has previously reported that deprivation was associated with trends in intervention and spending (Webb &amp; Bywaters, 2018; Bennett, et al. 2021), so cluster analysis may lead to interesting results. Further, prior research was limited to data between 2011 and 2019, and this research will update the dataset to include 2020 and 2021."

****

* Establishes why it may be academically interesting and how it is an extension of other research, but doesn't really appeal to why the research is important or the logic behind the method.

While other research has established that trends in interventions (Bennett, et al. 2021) and spending (Webb &amp; Bywaters, 2018) have been uneven depending on the the deprivation tertile of local authorities, no research has assessed whether trends in spending and interventions cluster into well-defined groups that may illustrate more complex inequalities that result from combinations of trends. Establishing informative clusters may enable policies to be developed that can start to identify and reverse increasing inequalities in intervention, and this will be aided by an exploration of what demographic and socioeconomic variables are associated with cluster membership."

### Introduction, rationale, research question

**Research Question**

.pull-left[

* **Multiple Linear Regression** [(Week 8)](https://calumwebb.co.uk/teaching/SMI606-content/week-8/slides/#1)
  * Multiple independent variables (dependent ~ independent) a.k.a. multiple predictors of the value of something you're interested in. Can be any type (continuous, ordinal, categorical)
  * Continuous dependent variable (outcome variable)
  * Key benefits: 
      * Adjust for the effect of potential confounding or mediating variables (see [Week 5](https://calumwebb.co.uk/teaching/SMI606-content/week-5/slides/#1)), e.g. the effect of gender on pay after adjusting for industry, public/private sector, education, age, family structure, etc. 
      * Compare the relative strength of each predictor, e.g. does having a postgraduate degree increase pay as much as only having an undergraduate degree.

.pull-right[

* **Multiple Logistic Regression** [(Week 9)](https://calumwebb.co.uk/teaching/SMI606-content/week-9/slides/#1)
  * Multiple independent variables (dependent ~ independent) a.k.a. multiple predictors of the value of something you're interested in. Can be any type (continuous, ordinal, categorical)
  * Binary categorical/ordinal dependent variable (outcome variable)
  * Key benefits: 
      * Adjust for the effect of potential confounding or mediating variables (see [Week 5](https://calumwebb.co.uk/teaching/SMI606-content/week-5/slides/#1)), e.g. are people from poorer backgrounds less likely to be accepted to elite universities after adjusting for A-level results, GCSE-results, and entry exam score? 
      * Compare the relative strength of each predictor, e.g. is housing affordability or distance from family home a stronger predictor of a young person not taking up a university offer?

### Introduction, rationale, research question

**Research Question**

.pull-left[

* **Cluster Analysis** [(Week 10)](https://calumwebb.co.uk/teaching/SMI606-content/week-10/slides/#1)
  * Multiple variables, neither independent or dependent, just features that define groups.
      * Variables should be all continuous with similar variance (for *k-means*) or a mixture of continuous, ordinal, and binary categorical (for *HCA*)
      * Usually more interesting if cluster assignment and cluster description is followed by some futher analysis like regression, but not required.
  * Key benefits: 
      * Aims to identify unobserved class membership based variable responses for when research questions are about hypotheses of underlying group-membership/behaviour.
      * Useful for studies about market segmentation, disrupting binary or limited classifications.


]

.pull-right[

* **Spatial Analysis** [(Week 11)](https://calumwebb.co.uk/teaching/SMI606-content/week-11/slides/#1)
  * Variables linked to spatial data; no independent or dependent variables but it will be common to compare more than one variable over space ('space' can be thought of as the independent variable), or the same variable in two different areas (cities, regions).
      * Variable distributed over space can be continuous, ordinal, or binary categorical (though most common in aggregate data is continuous)
      * Spatial weight matrix can be distance based (as learned in class and practical) or neighbours (contiguity/adjacency/shared borders) based (see [this guide](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spNetwork/vignettes/SpatialWeightMatrices.html)).
      * If challenging yourself with a [spatial lag model](https://calumwebb.co.uk/teaching/SMI606-content/assessment-2-guidance/spaMMintro.pdf) distance based matrices follow a Matérn function, neighbour matrices follow an adjacency function.

Lister (2004) argue that poverty is multidimensional and contains a socio-relational core. Spicker (2009) expands the multidimensional definition of poverty to include material conditions, economic circumstances, and social position, all of which can lead to 'unacceptable hardship'. More recently, studies have focused on 'types' of poverty, for example: Garthwaite (2016) has highlighted the rise of food poverty in the UK and Simcock, et al. (2016) have highlighted the rise of fuel poverty."

However, subsequent to austerity policies in the UK there has been a reversion to discussions of poverty as a lack of resources required for subsistence, including the normalisation of concepts such as food poverty (Garthwaite, 2016) and fuel poverty (Simcock, et al. 2016)."

* There has been an increased focus on the importance of national energy independence in light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. *Where is the focus? Who is focusing on what? States? NGOs? Everyday people? Academics?*

Doesn't need a reference:

* The Russian invasion of Ukraine has highlighted the importance of national energy independence. *This statement is okay because it's not passively implying an action or reaction of some implicit or explicit actor. It would benefit from a referenced example afterwards that illustrates how the invasion has highlighted the importance of the issue.*

### Literature review

**Top tips**

.pull-left[

* Group literature by theme, not by author.

* Have an argument or a story, don't just give a play-by-play.

* Make your literature review specifically related to your research question and illustrative of its contribution, not a general overview/"introduction to..."

* "How many references should I include?": **There is no set number**. You should include as many references as you have claims that require evidence.

### Literature review

**Top tips**

.pull-left[

* Group literature by theme, not by author.

* Have an argument or a story, don't just give a play-by-play.

* Make your literature review specifically related to your research question and illustrative of its contribution, not a general overview/"introduction to..."

* "How many references should I include?": There is no set number. You should include as many references as you have claims that require evidence.

* Your literature review should set the **scaffolding for your discussion**. What does your research add to what you reviewed?


]

.pull-right[

* For **linear/logistic regression**: does your analysis explore associations with a previously under-research group? Does it include a variable that wasn't previously included (either as a control or as the key thing of interest?)

* For **cluster analysis**: do your clusters add nuance to a concept or theory about underlying group memberships that we might have?

* For **spatial analysis**: does incorporating space tell us something new about a social problem or inequality between two areas that we hadn't previously explored?

Resources and support for literature reviewing is available from the [library](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/library/study/research-skills/discovering) and the [301 Skills Centre](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/academic-skills/study-skills-online/literature-reviews).

### Description of data

.pull-left[

Similar to assessment 1, you need to describe **where your data** (or the specific variables you are using from the dataset) **come from**, and **whether the data are a sample from which you can generalise** — as well as what population you can generalise to — or whether the data are an entire population.

  * If using provided data look in: the [description of datasets files](https://vle.shef.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/xid-43961409_1), in the codebook file included with each dataset, and on the web pages for any surveys (e.g. [Wellcome Trust Monitor 3](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=7927))
  * *This can require some googling of the variable/survey names in the codebook.*

### Findings

**Some people like to combine their findings and discussion, e.g.** This is fine.

"There was a significant association between age and the likelihood of voting to leave the European Union in the 2016 Brexit Referendum (p&lt;0.05), after adjusting for participants' home region, education levels, and past levels of political engagement. Each additional 10 years of age were associated with a 20% increase in the odds of voting to leave the EU. This finding corresponds with those of Becker, et al. (2017) who reported that support for Leave increased to 70% among voters aged 65 or over, compared to 27% for 18-24 year olds. The probability plot (Figure X) suggests that the strength of this association with was similar in this study even after controlling for region and education levels. This might suggest generational differences in attitudes towards the EU, or differences in the messaging and strategies of the leave and remain campaigns themselves, are a better explanation of support for leaving the EU among older people than the general political ennui of younger people or the lower (average) educational capital of older people required to interrogate the claims made by campaigns."

### Findings

**Some people like to keep their findings and discussion seperate, e.g.** This is also fine.

"There was a significant association between age and the likelihood of voting to leave the European Union in the 2016 Brexit Referendum (p&lt;0.05), after adjusting for participants' home region, education levels, and past levels of political engagement. Each additional 10 years of age were associated with a 20% increase in the odds of voting to leave the EU. The predicted probability plot (Figure X) suggests that support for leaving the EU was, on average, around 20-30% for people aged between 20 and 30 years old at the time of the survey but increases to between 50 to 70% for people aged between 60 and 70, holding education, region, and past levels of political engagement at average levels."

... *Later in the discussion section* ...

"In reviewing the literature, age was often reported as a significant predictor of support for leaving the EU but rarely considered the unequal levels of education and political participation between younger and older people. One of the aims of this study was to explore whether this increased support for Leave among older voters was consistent even after adjusting for differences associated with education and political participation. The regression model suggested that the strength of association between age and voting to leave the EU only diminished slightly after conditioning on education, region, and past political engagement, with estimated probabilities being similar to previously reported levels (Becker, et al. 2017). This might suggest generational differences in attitudes towards the EU, or differences in the messaging and strategies of the leave and remain campaigns themselves, are a better explanation of support for leaving the EU among older people than the general political ennui of younger people or the lower (average) educational capital of older people required to interrogate the claims made by campaigns."

.tuos_blue[While spatial analysis initially looks like the easiest, it can be deceptively difficult! It requires the most coding and the code can take a long time to run. 

It can also be hard to talk about choropleth maps if you don't have certain landmarks you can identify, so can rely on some knowledge about the area.]

This analysis found the opposite, that higher spending was associated with lower intervention rates. Increasing government spending may be an effective intervention for reducing the numbers of children taken into care, however, more research needs to be done."

****

* Doesn't identify why this study might have found different results.
* No acknowledgement of the context of the study.
* Lacks specificity: what further research should be done and where should it improve on this study?
* What is the story?? Quantitative research should build and develop narratives, not just add to a list of lab reports.

This analysis found that, after holding local authority trends constant and adjusting for changes in child poverty, higher spending in prior years was associated with lower intervention rates in subsequent years. Increasing government spending may be an effective intervention for reducing the numbers of children taken into care, but only when local authorities already have adequate resources to meet demand. This research currently underestimates the effect of spending, and further analysis is required to establish the indirect effects of greater spending on the numbers of children taken into care via the mechanism of services resolving children's needs at earlier points of crisis, such as in the Child Protection Plan or Child in Need stage."

* **Interpreting the p-value when it's not appropriate**, or getting the interpretation wrong (p &lt; 0.05 = significant)

]

--

* **Trying to explain how the statistical methods work; what a p-value is, etc.** You are not writing a methods textbook: you are writing a research report as an applied user of statistics.

  * It's better to only write: 'There was a statistically significant association between X and Y (p&lt;0.05)' &lt;svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" style="height:1em;position:relative;display:inline-block;top:.1em;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;  &lt;path d="M22 11.08V12a10 10 0 1 1-5.93-9.14"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;  &lt;polyline points="22 4 12 14.01 9 11.01"&gt;&lt;/polyline&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
      * Than to get it wrong by writing: 'There was a statistically significant association between X and Y (p &lt; 0.05), which means the results are very unlikely to be due to chance' &lt;svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" style="height:1em;position:relative;display:inline-block;top:.1em;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;  &lt;circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;  &lt;line x1="15" y1="9" x2="9" y2="15"&gt;&lt;/line&gt;  &lt;line x1="9" y1="9" x2="15" y2="15"&gt;&lt;/line&gt;&lt;/svg&gt; etc.

* **Trying to include lots and lots of univariate and bivariate descriptive statistics and visualisations like in assessment 1.** It's okay to include one, general table showing the mean, median, SD etc. of all of the variables you are using, but you will run out of words if you try and summarise all the bivariate relationships between them and describe them in-text.

--

* **Not giving yourself enough interesting things to talk about** (not ambitious enough number of variables, weak literature review/rationale)
