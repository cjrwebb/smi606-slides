############################       SMI606: Week 2 - Challenge      ################################
###################################################################################################

#' This challenge will test whether you have learned how to apply the skills used in week 1 and 
#' week 2. 
#' 
#' The purpose of challenges is to provide you with a much less structured activity so
#' that you can apply what you have learned in the step-by-step guides to a realistic environment:
#' one where you aren't being told what to do step by step! Having to engage in problem solving
#' will help you with real life applied data analysis and help you retain the new skills you
#' learn.
#' 
#' You can google as many questions as you wish to get the challenge finished. Some of the things
#' you need to do to complete the challenge won't necessarily have been taught in the workshops/
#' handouts and will rely on your own troubleshooting, independent study, and experimentation.
#' 
#' For this challenge you must:
#' 
#'   1. Generate descriptive statistics about the wealth of parliamentary candidates 
#'   in elections between 1950 and 1970 (from Eggers & Hainmueller, 2009 - 
#'   https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055409990190; data from Imai's textbook: 
#'   mps_simple.csv) including: what proportion of candidates were running
#'   as part of the Conservative (Tory) party, what proportion of candidates were
#'   running as part of the Labour party (Labour), and what their mean, median, 
#'   and modal wealth at death (net_wealth_at_death) was.
#'   
#'   2. Generate these descriptive statistics for only Tory candidates and for
#'   only Labour candidates. Hint: try checking out the filter() command help
#'   documentation and googling "How to filter by character variable value in R"
#'   or similar.
#'   
#'   3. Plot the distribution of wealth for each party's candidates using a
#'   histogram.
#' 
#' Good luck!
