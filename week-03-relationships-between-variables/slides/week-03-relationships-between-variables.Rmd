## Learning Objectives

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[What will I learn?]

By the end of this week you will:

* Learn how to __use variable types to select appropriate bivariate data visualisations and descriptive statistics__.

* Be able to create and interpret __bivariate bar charts, heatmaps, boxplots, ridgeplots, scatterplots, and hexbin plots__ using `R`.

* Be able to calculate and interpret several __bivariate descriptive statistics including__ __contingency tables, Cramer's V, Mean/Median differences, Spearman's $\rho$, and Pearson's R__ in `R`.


]

.panel[.panel-name[How does this week fit into my course?]

* Bivariate statistics an be important parts of research studies themselves, especially research studies with *a priori* controls (e.g. randomised controlled trials).

* Bivariate statistics and data visualisations are important for checking assumptions and for communicating findings in research. 

* Bivariate statistics can also be used to develop the rationale behind case studies in mixed methods research.


]


]



???

* Grid of variable types and relevant visualisations and descriptive statistics (no tests yet)

Filter out the missing values and then create a __two-way contingency table__ using `janitor`, which shows the __frequency__ of responses in every combination of categories across the two variables.

    ) %>% 
  janitor:: tabyl(imig_fct, dole_fct) %>%
  janitor::adorn_percentages("row")

```

Now, we use the `adorn_percentages()` function from the `janitor` package to convert these responses into __proportions within each row__. 

For example, the first row would read as: "For all of the survey respondents who said imigration should be reduced a lot, 30.4% said that benefits were too low, 14.5% said that benefits were neither too high nor too low, and 54.9% said that benefits were too high". 

The percentage here is based on the __row total__, because we specified "row" in the `adorn_percentages` function.

To turn this table into something ggplot can plot as a bar chart, we need to do a kind of confusing transformation.

We want all of the categories from our two variables to be in their own columns, with every valid combination, and then all of our proportions to be in their own column. For now, don't worry about what is going on with `pivot_longer`, just know that we can get from a janitor contingency tabyl into a structure we can plot using `pivot_longer(1)`.

```

The last thing we do before plotting is reset the benefits column (now called `name`, thanks to `pivot_longer`) back to a factor type with the levels in the correct order ("Too low", "Neither", "Too high"). This will help ggplot arrange them in an intuitive way.

```

Now we can plot the results. Note that with this kind of data format, where ggplot isn't doing any processing of statistics itself (we've already given it the proportions and are just telling them what they are), we switch to `geom_col` rather than using `geom_bar`.

Filter the missing data out of the dataset using `filter()` and then create a contingency table using `janitor::tabyl()`.

Here I've used the `pivot_longer` trick again, but I've also used the optional argument `names_to` to make the names of the columns be placed in a new column called "dole_fct", which makes the plotting a little clearer.

And now we can use `geom_tile` to create a heatmap. `geom_tile` essentially just draws squares on a grid, using the x and y variables as guides for locations. The `fill` optional argument can be used colour the tiles according to their value (here we are using frequencies, but we could have added the intermediate `adorn_percentages("row")` or `adorn_percentages("col")` function from `janitor` to make these row or column proportions)

We can use the `coord_fixed(1)` function to force a 1 to 1 relationship between the X and Y axis, this will make the tiles display as perfect squares (which looks quite nice!)

Finally, we can use `scale_fill_gradient2()` to set any arbitrary fill colour scale between two colours we choose (here, a white and a green). `R` has a list of pre-named colours (you can see all of these by running `colors()` in your console), or you can use any hex code colour (e.g. <span style="color:#B00100">#B00100</span>)

The degrees of freedom (df) are calculated by subtracting 1 from the smallest number of rows or columns in our crosstab.

For example here we have 6 rows and 4 columns; 4 is smaller than 6; so our "df" is equal to 4 minus 1, which equals 3.

For 3 degrees of freedom a result of 0.1169 could be interpreted as a __weak__ association between attitudes towards immigration and benefits policies.

Spearman's Rank Order Correlation is __directional__, Cramer's V is __not__.

Cohen's (1988) commonly used effect sizes for rho:

* 0 to 0.1 or 0 to -0.1: Negligible
* 0.1 to 0.3 or -0.1 to -0.3: Weak
* 0.3 to 0.5 or -0.3 to -0.5: Moderate
* 0.5 to 1 or -0.5 to -1: Strong

However, __context matters most__: if you are looking for things that might affect an outcome __at scale__, or __when assessing a potentially cheap intervention__ even a relatively weak effect size is important.

* If the evidence suggested giving students a free notepad and pen at the start of a semester had a weak effect on their grades, would we do it?
* If the evidence suggested giving students £1million at the start of a semester had a strong effect on their grades, would we do it?

## Data preparation: Recoding

It's sometimes necessary to "recode" variables. Some reasons why you may want to do this are:

--

* To combine some related groups within each there are __too small a number of cases to be statistically informative__ (generally, fewer than 30 is not very informative for frequentist hypothesis testing)

--

* To compress certain groups to make a __data visualisation more clear or appealing__, or to use a different type of visualisation.

--

* __To remove missing data categories__ that were placed in the data to be informative but are not needed for your analysis

--

* Example of ways you might recode a variable:
  * Recoding a 7-point Likert scale to a 5-point scale; 
  * Turning a continuous variable like age into an ordinal variable like 'age group'; 
  * Turning an ordinal variable into a binary variable, e.g. simplifying a five point scale from Strongly Agree -- Strongly Disagree into a simple "Agree / Does not agree" binary;
  * Changing the categorical responses "Refused to answer", "Not applicable", and "Not sure" into `NA`.

* Can easily end up with overplotting - especially with discrete variables.

Possible solutions:

* Add jitter to points (artificially spread them out from their true value) - not great as it manipulates data.
* Make points smaller - useful for overplotting with continuous variables but less useful for discrete
* Add transparency - same as above

Or...

* Use a hexbin plot.

Pearson's correlation coefficient R, is a measure of __how closely associated the variance in one variable is with the variance in another variable__, relative to the maximum possible covariance they could share.

* `-1` = Perfect negative correlation - as the value of one variable increases the other decreases.
* `0 ` = No correlation - changes in the value of one variable are not associated with changes in the other.
* `1` = Perfect positive correlation - as the value of one variable increases the other also increases.

__Rules of thumb__:

* ±0.01 - 0.19 = Very weak/Negligible correlation
* ±0.20 - 0.39 = Weak correlation
* ±0.40 - 0.59 = Moderate correlation
* ±0.60 - 0.79 = Strong correlation
* ±0.80 - 0.99 = Very strong correlation

## Difference between Spearman & Pearson

.pull-left[

* Pearson's correlation relies on the use of means and variance (__assuming normal distribution__), and therefore can be sensitive to outliers or non-linearity (relationships that aren't a straight line).

* Spearman's correlation uses the __rank__ order association, so outliers will not affect it if the rank order remains the same.

# Summary

<br>

* There are a large range of ways to visualise and statistically describe relationships between variables in `R`; __appropriate methods can be chosen by considering the type of variables we wish to analyse using what we learned in Week 2.__ 

--

* __Visualisations of relationships__ between variables can help us get a full and proportionate picture of relationships, whereas __bivariate descriptive statistics__ (contingency tables, Spearman's Rho, Cramer's V, and Pearson's R) can give us a standardised, shorthand way of describing what these relationships are.

* Note: I don't expect you to remember all of these different methods: __Use the table and the slides as a cheat sheet__! When viewing the slides on your computer you can press "o" on your keyboard to quickly browse through them all.
