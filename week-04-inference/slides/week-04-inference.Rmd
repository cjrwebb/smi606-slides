## Learning Objectives

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[What will I learn?]

By the end of this week you will:

* Get to grips with the intuition behind using inferential statistics for hypothesis testing.
* Be able to interpret a p-value from a hypothesis test, in conjunction with a critical value. 
* Be able to judge when the use of hypothesis testing for generalisation of findings is appropriate depending on the kind of sample our data is from.
* Understand the intuition of some common statistical tests for testing the relationship between two variables.

]

.panel[.panel-name[How does this week fit into my course?]

* Hypothesis testing is an essential skill for doing quantitative social research, and plays to the strengths of quantitative methods for identifying social patterns.
* In order to accurately assess the results from reading other social science research publications, you must be able to interpret the results from statistical significance tests (and p-values) — even if you don't do quantitative research yourself!
* You should have a good sense of the theory behind hypothesis testing to ensure that you use it responsibly and effectively in a research career, including if you are in a leadership role.

# Over the last two week we have learned how to describe the different types of variables in data and relationships between them.


---

class: inverse, middle

# But how can we be confident that a relationship or pattern in our data applies to the entire population we are interested in, and isn't just an artefact of our specific sample?

???

But this week we are interested in how we can generalise the kinds of patterns, or tendencies, or relationships in our data to the population as a whole. 

How can we be confident that something we find in a random sample is generalisable knowledge? 

Statistical methods that help us do this are called Inferential Statistics.

Before we talk about how inferential statistics are used and expressed in practice, I'd like you to join in with a practical activity with me. 

If you can start by loading up the Shiny app either on your phone by scanning the QR code, or by clicking the link in the chat, and giving it a couple of minutes to load while I explain what we'll be doing.

So, imagine for a moment that we've been contracted by a Las Vegas casino who have discovered that half of their dice are loaded and do not roll numbers fairly. The problem is, they don't know which of their dice are loaded and which of them are fair.

Our task is to roll the die and use our data analysis skills to determine whether the die each of us has been been allocated is fair or unfair. 

[Start practical activity: show 20 rolls as an example, inspect outcomes, ask participants to roll die twenty times and inspect their outcome, then do 'hands up' confidence check before repeating two more times. Remember to mention that at the end I would ask people to reflect on what happened to their confidence as they increased the size of their sample. ]

With what we would expect if the die were fair -- we know already what kind of distribution we would expect to see if a die were completely fair, we'd call this our null hypothesis, but we also know there is a lot of randomness in the world and that our dice rolls would very very rarely ever look exactly like this.

We can express how unlikely we were to get results like this if the die was fair using a **p-value**.

There are many different kinds of inferential statistics and tests we can use for different hypotheses and kinds of relationships in data. The one we use here is called a __chi-squared goodness-of-fit test__ but don't worry about how it's calculated at this point!

We can quantify how likely we are to see something like this using a *p-value*.

There are many different kinds of tests that produce p-values, and as we go forward into the next few weeks you will learn which ones should be used for what kinds of research questions and types of data. For the exercise we're doing here, we can use a very simple test called a chi-squared test -- don't worry about what that means or how it's calculated for now! Right now, we just want to focus on the p-value.

So how do we use that information.

13.55% is quite a low probability of something happening, but it's not completely unreasonable. Should we report this die as unfair or not?

In applied social statistics, we often pick a pre-defined critical value in conjunction with the p-value from our test to make that judgement call.

In social science, we usually say that if the p-value is less than 0.05 (or 5%), we reject the null hypothesis, because the results we got are sufficiently unlikely to have happened if it were true.

# Hypothesis testing
<br>

.pull-left[

In applied statistics, we compare our p-value with a pre-chosen 'critical value' (sometimes called *alpha*) below which we decide to reject the null hypothesis. 

* Conventionally, our critical value, **below which we reject the null hypothesis**, is __0.05__.

There is no strong reason why 5% is used in the social sciences, and sometimes 10%, 1% or 0.1% are used instead, but it can depend on the following:
  * What are the risks if we set our critical value too high and incorrectly reject the null hypothesis? __(Type I error; false positive)__
  * What are the risks if we set our critical value too low and incorrectly fail to reject the null hypothesis? __(Type II error; false negative)__
  
5%, or 0.05, is often seen as a good compromise between these two risks.

Why do we pick 5%?

There is not really any strong reason, but it is conventionally considered to be a good balance between the risk of us wrongly rejecting the null hypothesis - wrongly reporting that the dice isn't fair when it is - which is called a type 1 error; and us wrongly failing to reject the null hypotheiss - wrongly claiming the dice is fair when it actually isn't.

It's common to see critical values of 10%, 5%, 1% or 0.1% chosen, and this should depend on the specific risk of making an error in a given research context. 

For example, in drug testing we might want to set a much lower critical value so we don't inadvertantly give people ineffective treatments, but we wouldn't want to make it so low that we end up rejecting potentially beneficial treatments.

So, to recap, for this set of dice rolls our p-value was 0.1355.

Our critical value to reject the hypothesis that the die is fair is 0.05.

0.1355 is more than 0.05, and therefore, based on the criteria we set we should not reject our hypothesis that the die is fair. 

We use these tools to make our decision that our data does not support the idea that this particular die is unfair.

Don't worry if this this difficult to grasp right away! It is difficult stuff and no one is comfortable understanding or interpreting p-values correctly the first time they see them. The best way to learn is through practice and repetition. 

We will be doing this multiple times over this week and in the following weeks with different tests - the majority of them will use p-values so you will become very familiar with them!

# Can you see how this statistic performs a similar function to our intuition when raising our hand when we feel confident that the die is or is not fair?

*Now I want you to roll your dice as many times as you think would be a good sample, use the Chi-Square test calculated on the last tab to decide whether you think it is fair or not, and then check if you got it right!*

???

The main thing I want you to think about at the end of this session is this:

* Can you see how this statistic helps quantify the confidence we have in something based on what we observe in our data? Can you see how it gives us a tool to make those decisions about turning something we observe into a more general claim?

* The easiest way to know a sample is proportionally representative of the population is by finding out how the sample was collected.

  * Ignore your invitations to join the sample
  * Refuse to answer questions
  * Withdraw from the study

# _Post-hoc_ adjustment for representativeness

* __Sample weighting__: researchers calculate 'survey weights' which can be used to 're-balance' each observation so that the overall sample proportionally matches the population of interest.

--

  * For example, __imagine we wanted a representative sample of England & Wales.__

--

  * __Approximately 5%__ of people in England & Wales live in Wales.

--

  * We used a stratified sampling method to __survey 1,000 people__ in England and Wales. Ideally, we want 950 English respondents and 50 Welsh respondents.

--

  * However, we ended up with 100 Welsh respondents and 900 English.

--

  * We could count each of those Welsh respondents as only 0.5 of a respondent, and every one of the English respondents as 1.055 of a respondent to "re-balance" our sample to be proportionate to the population.
  
--

In reality this process is far more complicated but that's the basic jist of it! In reality, survey data will come with weights already calculated. You can apply them in analysis using the [`survey` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survey/survey.pdf) in `R`, but this is more something to worry about for a PhD project. For now, don't worry about weighting data.
  

---

class: middle

# _Post-hoc_ adjustment for representativeness<br>(Non-response)

We can also have a scenario where we get a proportionally representative sample from our population, but then __not all of this sample respond to all questions or have data for all variables__ (e.g. some might refuse). This would mean that some analyses will end up 'unbalanced' due to this __missing data__ (usually coded as `NA` in `R`) when it is removed.

--

* Multiple ways of dealing with missing data: most common are *listwise* and *pairwise* deletion — where entire observations are deleted if they have missing data in a variable of interest. __This unbalances our sample__.

--

* However, we can try to **impute** missing data — e.g. fill in all of the missing values with our 'best guess' of what it would have been based on responses from respondents who are the most similar to them.

--

* Some methods have specific procedures for handling missing data (e.g. FIML).

--

__Imputation__ and __maximum likelihood__ is too complex a topic to cover here, but is something to be aware of if you are doing a quantitative PhD.

# Inference in experimental designs

If your research uses an **experimental** design (e.g. a survey experiment or a randomised controlled trial), you are usually aiming to test the significant differences between the groups *within* your sample. You might try and make your sample representative, but this is often difficult due to cost.

--

This is handled through **a priori randomisation** of conditions (randomly assigning participants to either 'treatment' or 'control' conditions). Because the __assignment is random__, statistical significance/inferential statistics can be used to generalise to the group who participated in the study as a whole. 

--

In other words, inferential statistics can be used to determine __whether the difference between the 'treatment' group and 'control' group would have been different to what would be expected under the null hypothesis if the groups were reverse, or if the random assignment was different__.

* __No significant outliers__: any large outliers should be identified and removed.
* **Bivariate normal distribution**: the variables should have a bivariate normal distribution. This is always the case if both variables are normally distributed and their relationship is linear, but can also be the case if one or both are non-normally distributed if, for example, the residuals around a line of best fit between them are normally distributed.

# Summary

* Hypothesis tests are one important way we can make broader __generalisations about our findings__ from the data. This can be very powerful.
* _p-values_ and _critical/alpha values_ can be used to make judgements about whether we have enough evidence to reject a given null hypothesis; __if our p-value is lower than our critical value (usually 0.05), we can reject the null hypothesis__.
* The __results of hypothesis tests are determined by sample size__ and by the __strength of the association__ between variables.
* However, their use requires considerable caution to ensure that:
  * We select __the correct kind of hypothesis test__ for our data.
  * p-values are __interpreted correctly__.
  * Hypothesis tests are __used appropriately__ (on a suitable kind of sample or within an appropriate study design).
  * We report any possible __violations of assumptions__.
