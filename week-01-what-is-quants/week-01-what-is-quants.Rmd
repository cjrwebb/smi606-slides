## Learning Objectives

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[What will I learn?]

By the end of this week you will:

* Know where to find relevant information for participating in the module, including where to locate module resources and how to prepare for each week's class time.
* Be able to differentiate between quantitative social research approaches and qualitative research approaches and the way they shape our view of the social/human world.
* Be able to describe some of the reasons why quantitative research can be useful, while being cautious around the pitfalls of its methods and methodology.
* Have installed `R` and Rstudio and be able to interact with the console, run scripts, check help documentation, distinguish between environmental object types, and read in data.

]

.panel[.panel-name[How does this week fit into my course?]

* Help you schedule your independent learning for the rest of the module to fit within the demands of the programme.
* Give you an indication of when quantitative research projects (or components of projects) may be useful, and see how the content of SMI606 fits together with SMI607 Principles of Social Research I and Principles of Research Design II.
* Introduce you to `R`, a flexible open-source statistical programming language that can be used for quantitative data analysis but also for presenting, reporting, and other purposes.

]



]



???

* Introduce you to the module and instructors, structure and timetable, resources and support available, contingencies for COVID and remote support
* Introduce the concept of quantitative social science and the assumptions it makes about the human world: why do we use it? What do we assume when we use it? How do we make sense of it? These will be explored more in SMI607 Principles of Social Research I
* Introduce `R`, install `R`, and talk about the layout of Rstudio, different kinds of variables in the R environment, and how to read in and manipulate data (basic filtering, subsetting).

## Module design, timetable, and support

* Introductions to important statistical principles and methods in quantitative social science.
  * Intuition *over* equations.

--

* 'Hands-on' experience putting these principles into practice in `R` using real-world data. 

--

* Assessment on two small quantitative research projects where the topic is decided by you.

---

class: middle

## Module design, timetable, and support

__Time__: 12:00-13:50 Tuesdays (Week 1-5, 7-11)  
__Location__: Room C28 in the Portobello Centre

__Consultation & Feedback Hours__: 16:00-17:00 Tuesdays (Week 1-12)  
*Can be booked online or face-to-face. See: [how to book](https://calumwebb.co.uk/teaching/appointments/).*

### Maths and Statistics Help (MASH)

The Maths and Statistics Help (MASH) service on Glossop Road provide 1:1 and group support on learning statistics in `R`. You can book a tutorial by [visiting their webpages](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/mash).

## Responsibilities and expectations

As a rough guideline you __should expect to devote around 10 hours of study time per week to this module__ during a typical 15-week semester.

--

__It is up to you to identify your learning needs__ and use the resources provided to meet them. I am happy to help you with this process.

--

To ensure your independent learning is productive, you should __regularly think about what parts of the module are challenging you__.

--

But as a general rule you should follow the reading list and **work through ~1 chapter of the textbook per week**, as well as **finish any practical work started in the class**.

--

And lastly, remember to **ask for help if you need it!** There is no such thing as a stupid question.

__Du Bois engaged in the continuous systemic collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of public health-related data in people of various racial groups__ [between 1896 and 1897] ... Du Bois' analysis and interpretation of racism led to his summative pronouncement that __systemic inequality was associated with increasing health risks and high mortality rates__ .grey[... When he connected the systemic inequality of racism to education, criminal justice, poverty, and employment, Du Bois demonstrated the importance of a multidisciplinary collaborative lens of social epidemiological research. ... Du Bois' recommended interventions and strategies to confront the determinants of health and determinants of death in the 7th Ward would have been well posed for policy development aimed at combating racism and eliminating health disparities.]
