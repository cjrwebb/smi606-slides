## Learning Objectives

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[What will I learn?]

By the end of this week you will:

* Know where to find relevant information for participating in the module, including where to locate module resources and how to prepare for each week's class time.
* Be able to differentiate between quantitative social research approaches and qualitative research approaches and the way they shape our view of the social/human world.
* Be able to describe some of the reasons why quantitative research can be useful, while being cautious around the pitfalls of its methods and methodology.
* Have installed `R` and Rstudio and be able to interact with the console, run scripts, check help documentation, distinguish between environmental object types, and read in data.

]

.panel[.panel-name[How does this week fit into my course?]

* Help you schedule your independent learning for the rest of the module to fit within the demands of the programme.
* Give you an indication of when quantitative research projects (or components of projects) may be useful, and see how the content of EDC459 fits together with Principles of Social Research I and Principles of Research Design II.
* Introduce you to `R`, a flexible open-source statistical programming language that can be used for quantitative data analysis but also for presenting, reporting, and other purposes.

]



]



???

* Introduce you to the module and instructors, structure and timetable, resources and support available, contingencies for COVID and remote support
* Introduce the concept of quantitative social science and the assumptions it makes about the human world: why do we use it? What do we assume when we use it? How do we make sense of it? These will be explored more in Principles of Social Research I
* Introduce `R`, install `R`, and talk about the layout of Rstudio, different kinds of variables in the R environment, and how to read in and manipulate data (basic filtering, subsetting).

For any general enquiries about administration during the module — registration, extensions, assessment submission, attendance, timetable issues, and so on — please contact the Student Experience team [smi@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:smi@sheffield.ac.uk) who will be happy to help you. Remember, as per the module outline, that module leaders cannot grant extensions.

## Module design, timetable, and support

* Introductions to important statistical principles and methods in quantitative social science.
  * Intuition *over* equations.

--

* 'Hands-on' experience putting these principles into practice in `R` using real-world data. 

--

* Assessment on two small quantitative research projects where the topic is decided by you.


---

class: middle

## Module design, timetable, and support

__Time & Location__: Time & Location: 12:00-14:50 in Geography Building, Computer Room B04 (Tuesdays, Week 1-6, 8-11) 

__Consultation & Feedback Hours__: 10:00-11:00 Tuesdays (Week 1-12) and 15:00-16:00 Thursdays (Week 1-12). [Book through Google Calendar by clicking here](https://calendar.app.google/H7Eynbsnyh9S8VvH8).

### Maths and Statistics Help (MASH)

The Maths and Statistics Help (MASH) service on Glossop Road provide 1:1 and group support on learning statistics in `R`. You can book a tutorial by [visiting their webpages](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/mash).

**R for Ultra Beginners** Workshops will usually be running through the first few weeks of the semester!

---

## Responsibilities and expectations

As a rough guideline you __should expect to devote around 10 hours of study time per week to this module__ during a typical 15-week semester.

--

__It is up to you to identify your learning needs__ and use the resources provided to meet them. I am happy to help you with this process.

--

To ensure your independent learning is productive, you should __regularly think about what parts of the module are challenging you__.

--

Reading is not *strictly required*, but it will probably help. Past students have said they found the lecture materials and the workshops sufficient to understand the content. **If you are pressed for time, prioritise completing workshop materials and R challenges in your independent study time.**

--

And lastly, remember to **ask for help if you need it!** There is no such thing as a stupid question.

* `R` has a __steep learning curve__.
* `R`, mostly, __does not use menus__.
* `R` can have __unhelpful error messages__.
* `R` requires __learning how to code at the same time as learning methods and statistical theory__.

# Academic Misconduct & Integrity


.pull-left-big[

Types of academic misconduct: 

* **Plagiarism**
  * You must not resubmit already submitted work (self-plagiarism) in assessment, even if that work was used in a different course/institution. You must ensure all sources are adequately and correctly cited.
* **Essay or code buying**
  * Self-explanatory: all of your work must be your own.
* **Collusion**
  * While I encourage you to work together on the class exercises and challenges, you must not work together on your assessments. I'd encourage you to pick different research topics than your friends so that you can still chat about your assessments without collusion
* **Fabrication**
  * You'll be expected to use real data and you must not fabricate data for the purpose of assessment.
* **Generative AI (False Authorship)**
  * You must not use generative AI to write any of your code for you or to conduct any analysis used in your assessment.

# TellUS and Student Feedback

.pull-left-big[

The university is committed to **acting on student feedback**. Here are some examples of how the module has been developed based on student feedback in the past:

* Past students wanted answer sheets to be added to the R exercises so that they could get immediate feedback on whether they had interpreted the question correctly. **These have been added to all of the weekly R exercise folders.**
* Past students wanted there to be more of a bridge between the worksheets and being able to do your own analysis as expected in the assessments. **Each week a challenge has been added that requires you to apply your learning in a slightly less guided way, to help prepare you for the assessment.**
* Past students wanted more guidance on how to complete the assessments. **There are now two videos with detailed assessment guidance and a walkthrough for completing the first assessment.**
* Students wanted rapid feedback on their understanding. **Knowledge checks have been added throughout the module.**
* Students wanted more guidance on how they could and couldn't use generative AI in a way that wouldn't cause concerns about academic misconduct. **AI guidance was developed with specific reference to writing code and doing quantitative research.**

__Du Bois engaged in the continuous systemic collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of public health-related data in people of various racial groups__ [between 1896 and 1897] ... Du Bois' analysis and interpretation of racism led to his summative pronouncement that __systemic inequality was associated with increasing health risks and high mortality rates__ .grey[... When he connected the systemic inequality of racism to education, criminal justice, poverty, and employment, Du Bois demonstrated the importance of a multidisciplinary collaborative lens of social epidemiological research. ... Du Bois' recommended interventions and strategies to confront the determinants of health and determinants of death in the 7th Ward would have been well posed for policy development aimed at combating racism and eliminating health disparities.]
